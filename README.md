# TI-NSpire Python CAS

A simple Python program I've been developing on my TI-NSpire CX II calculator to replicate the abilities of the CAS software. It's a work in progress, and it will probably never get very good, but it can take simple derivatives and simplify expressions in some ways.

It consists of a simple tokenizer, parser, and evaluator with support for arithmetic, variables, and built-in functions (currently only `sin` and `cos`). For example:
```python

```

Most of the code in this repository is written on my calculator and exported to my computer, but I'm trying to avoid TI-specific Python modules to make it portable.

The code isn't structured very well, but it's mostly me messing around, so I'm not super worried about making a robust codebase.
